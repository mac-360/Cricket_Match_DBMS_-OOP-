Cricket Simulation using OOP

==============================

This Cricket Simulation program is built using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to provide an immersive cricket simulation experience. The program incorporates several key OOP principles such as classes, multiple inheritance, abstraction, overriding, vectors, and file handling. It also aims to replicate the functionality of a SQL query by allowing users to add, remove, update, and view player data using a unique ID. The simulation can simulate a complete series of any number of overs with live commentary and provides highlights as well.

OOP Concepts Used:

1. Classes: The program utilizes classes to model various entities such as teams, players, commentators. Each class encapsulates relevant data and behavior, allowing for easy management and interaction between different entities.
2. Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance is used to establish relationship of Match with the rest of the classes. 
4. Overriding: The program utilizes function overriding, which is a key feature of polymorphism. 
5. Vectors: Vectors, which are dynamic arrays, are used to store and manage collections of objects. The program employs vectors to handle data structures such as teams, players etc.
6. File Handling: The program uses file handling to read and write data from external files. It maintains separate files for all entities ensuring accurate storage and retrieval of data.
Functionality:

1. Score Display: The program offers a score display feature that allows users to view scores from previous matches. This feature provides historical context and allows users to compare performance across different simulations.

2. Team and Player Management: Users can manage teams and players by adding, removing, updating, and viewing their data. Each player is assigned a unique ID, which is used for identification and data manipulation.

3. Innings Files: The program maintains separate files for the first and second innings, storing detailed match information. This includes ball-by-ball data, player statistics, and overall match scores. The separation of innings files allows for easy access and management of match data.
5.Fast Track Feature: The program includes a Fast Track feature that allows users to sit back and enjoy the simulation as it automatically runs. This feature replicates a real cricket match experience by progressing through the simulation without user intervention.
SQL Query Replication:
The program replicates some aspects of a SQL query by providing functionalities to add, remove, update, and view player data using a unique player ID. Users can interact with the program to perform these operations and manipulate player data as needed.

Simulating a Complete Series:
The simulation is designed to simulate a complete series of cricket matches. The user can specify the number of overs for each match and enjoy live commentary during the gameplay. The program aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging cricket simulation experience by replicating the excitement and dynamics of a real series.

Highlights:
The program offers a highlights feature that provides users with the ability to relive exciting moments from a match. The highlights showcase significant events, such as boundaries, wickets, and outstanding performances, enhancing the overall experience of the simulation.
